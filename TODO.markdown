# MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

The following items still remain for the MVP:

- Allow user to unfollow user
- Only show logout link when logged in (on all pages, not just vote)
    - Find good way to pass session variables into all templates, preferably
      without having to explicitly put argument in all render calls.
- New pages
    - Show users whose tweets you've voted on
    - Show all tweets you've voted on for a specific person (link from above)
    - Show unfollow recommendations
